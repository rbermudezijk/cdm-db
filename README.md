# CDM - Database

## Get started

This repository provides all information about the "Cerca de mi" database (CLAROPAY schema).  Please, if you add important changes in the database schema then you must add the required documentation to understand it.

The project is divided into two sections:

 - __code__: This folder contents all scripts required that help you to replicate the [database schema](./code/schema), to see the [database schema changes](./code/schema-changes-log) across the time, and [maintenance](./code/maintenance) scripts that are required when it is needed to add new data to some tables.

 - __wikis__: This folder contents the specific documentation to make important tasks like _understand_ the main schema, _maintenance_ schema and database _deployments_.

Finally, if you find something that seems inaccurate or is questionable, any feedback is welcome to us, and you are freely to add new comments or documentation that make it better (Don't forget add your contact data to authors list).
